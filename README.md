# Zoo Animal Program

This project is a part of the final challenge of the course "Introduction to Software Development" by Amazon. It demonstrates the use of interfaces, inheritance, and polymorphism in Java. The program allows the user to choose an animal from the Zoo and then perform various operations on the chosen animal. The user can set properties, display properties, display movement, and display eating behavior of the chosen animal.

## Features

- Menu-driven interface to interact with different animals.
- Allows setting and displaying properties of animals.
- Demonstrates movement and eating behavior of animals.
- Uses interfaces, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Animals

The program includes the following animals:

- Tiger
- Dolphin
- Penguin

## Usage

1. **Animal Choice Menu**: The user can choose an animal from the Zoo.
2. **Animal Details Manipulation Menu**: The user can perform various operations on the chosen animal:
    - Set properties
    - Display properties
    - Display movement
    - Display eating behavior

## Example

Here is an example of how the program works:

1. The user is presented with a menu to choose an animal.
2. After choosing an animal, the user can set or display the animal's properties, display its movement, or display its eating behavior.
3. The user can continue interacting with the chosen animal or go back to the main menu to choose another animal.

## Running the Program

To run the program, execute the `Main` class. The program will prompt you with the animal choice menu and guide you through the available options.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Program entry point
    }
}
```
